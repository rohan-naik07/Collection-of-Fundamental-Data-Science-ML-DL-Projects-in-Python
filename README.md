# Collection-of-Fundamental-Data-Science-ML-DL-Mini-Projects
This Repository contains 10 Fundamental Grassroots-driven Machine Learning & Deep Learning Projects ranging from various domains in Data Science using Python. Almost every ML algorithm and Data Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) concept has been implemented and used in one or many of the projects. These projects are aimed at achieving a conceptual level of practical understanding of almost every type of problem under the hood in Data Science. The Projects range from Regression and Classification problems to Image Recognition in CV (Computer Vision) and Tweets Classifier **Put something good n appropriate here** in NLP (Natural Language Processing).  

The link for all the data sets and the best fitting models developed for it have been provided in the individual folders.
